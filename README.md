This is a Bank Account Simulation that was created in my Program Design 1 course. It simulates a bank to where you can add accounts
from user input, read and add accounts from a previously saved text file. You are able to create savings/checkings account, in the
checkings you get a 5% intrest added to the balance for every 10 deposits and for the savings it is the same except a 20% intrest rate. 
The savings account will also have a 5% withdrawal fee everytime 3 consecutive withdrawals are performed with no deposit. There is a bank
object used to maintain the accounts with methods like addAccount, findAccount, and deleteAccount, as wells asgetAverageBalance, getMaxBalance, 
getMinBalance, and getLowBalanceAccounts. The getLowBalanceAccounts took advantage of a balance threshHold value attribute in the Bank class. 
The BankAccount objects held all the personal information for each accountincluing accountNumber, accountName, dateCreated, currentBalance, and 
withdrawalLimit. Also methods such as withdrawal and deposit.
